    "What's perhaps surprising is that Israel's song score ended up rather low. Netta came twelfth in that category. Austria's performance score was up there with its song score but the staging left a lot to be desired, according to our voters. One other interesting discrepancy I'd like to note is Moldova's similarly bonkers song, which scored in the top three for staging, but a lot lower in song and performance."

In 2018, about two thirds of songs were in English, and the rest were in their native languages. The only oddity was Estonia's entry, where Elina Nechayeva performed the operatic La Forza in Italian."

But honestly, the variance in the data is so high that I'm not confident calling this a real finding. It might just be the case that it skewed positive because Israel and Finland were near the end.
